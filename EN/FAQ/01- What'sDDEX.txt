DDEX is the most user-friendly decentralized exchange for Ethereum-based tokens.

As a decentralized exchange, DDEX does not rely on third parties to hold users’ assets (unlike large, centralized exchanges). The trading on DDEX occurs directly between buyers and sellers in a peer-to-peer (P2P) network via an automated process. This way, there is no single point of failure. 

On DDEX:

We are designed to provide liquidity for Ethereum and ERC-20 tokens directly from users’ wallet (eg., MetaMask, Ledger).
We utilize off-chain matching and on-chain settlement. The off-chain order book matching provides a more user-friendly experience for users to trade ERC-20 tokens on our platform.

We can list popular token pairs immediately.
We allow users to exchange ERC-20 tokens directly from wallet to wallet.
No possibility of theft
No uncertainty of deposit/withdrawal lockup periods
No withdrawal fees
We do not require users to register for a DDEX account. You can start trading right away.
